<h3 align="center">Enable the metaverse of crypto in Minecraft</h3>
  
MetaCity is a way for people all around the world to participate in building something truly unique. The first ever virtually purchasable and actually ownable property within Minecraft, inside a virtual MMO world, where players have lifetime assets in the same world that never resets. The land itself is an entire city with different plots of interest around the map. Claim your favourite plot position before they're all gone!

We do this by utilising the Enjin platform, which itself is just a token on the Ethereum blockchain.
